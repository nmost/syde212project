## What is it

For this project, we are taking a look at 1000 random Wikipedia articles. Within these articles, we count the number of references.
Of course, doing this manually would take a large amount of work, so we've developed a script to do this for us.

We are going to compare the number of references for random articles in multiple languages (just french and english for now), and draw our conclusions from the gathered data.
